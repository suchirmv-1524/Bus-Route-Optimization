<h1 align="center">Bus Route Optimization Using Tarjan's Algorithm</h1>

## About

* This project aims to optimize bus routes by using Tarjan's algorithm to identify and resolve articulation points in a bus route network. 
* Articulation points are critical nodes where the removal could significantly impact route connectivity and efficiency.
* By detecting and addressing these points, the project seeks to improve the reliability and effectiveness of public transportation systems.

## Approach

* Graph Representation: Model the bus route network as a graph, with bus stops as nodes and connections between stops as edges.
* Articulation Point Detection: Apply Tarjan's algorithm to detect articulation points in the graph. These points represent critical nodes that, if removed, would significantly impact route connectivity.
* Route Adjustment: Recommend route adjustments or infrastructure improvements to resolve articulation points and optimize bus routes.
